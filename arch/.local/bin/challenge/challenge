Welcome to the Foris developer mini-challenge!
Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. **Download SQL Dump**

    Choose between a MySQL or a PostgreSQL dump:
    - For a local MySQL (version 8) environment,
      download the dump from the endpoint
      /dumps/mysql.
    - For a local PostgreSQL (versions 13-15)
      environment, download the dump from the
      endpoint /dumps/psql.
    - For an online PostgreSQL environment,
      download the SQL script from the endpoint
      /dumps/onlinepsql.

   Note: If you are using Postman, make sure you
   execute the request with `Send and Download` as
   shown here
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38975718/how-to-download-excel-xls-file-from-api-in-postman.

2. **Import Database**

    If you chose one of the local SQL
    environments, import the downloaded SQL dump
    into your local environment by your preferred
    method (tested via terminal). Make sure the
    import process completes successfully.

    If you chose the online PostgreSQL
    environment, head to
    https://sqliteonline.com/, click on PostgreSQL
    on the left sidebar, paste the dump contents,
    and run the script. You should see the created
    tables on the sidebar.

3. **Inspect Database**

    Take a moment to examine the imported database
    to understand its structure, including the
    models and data it contains.

4. **Query Database**

    Use an SQL query to find the answer to the
    following question: "How many students who
    enrolled in at least 5 groups between the
    start of February 5 and the end of February 7,
    enrolled in at least one subject with a code
    ending in `1`?"

   **Warning!** The value `2024-02-07` represents
   the start of February 7, not its end.

5. **Validate your answer**

   You can validate your answer sending a `POST`
   request to /validate.

   The body must look like: `{"number_of_groups":
   NUMBER_OF_GROUPS, "answer": YOUR_ANSWER}`

   * `NUMBER_OF_GROUPS`: Is the number of groups
     present in the table `group` of the given
     dump. By giving this you prove that you
     successfully inspect your database.

   * `YOUR_ANSWER`: Is the answer of the question
     asked in the previous step.

   This query can be executed only once per hour,
   so be careful when you send the request.

6. **Submit Your Answer**

    When you are done, submit your answer in the
    questionnaire provided when submitting your
    application via Getonboard.

That's it! Good luck with the challenge.
